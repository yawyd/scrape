Note that the class is given as "_mi _3k _2j _3w"


Pinterest seems to have between 15 and 18 pics associated with the page at a time. It changes which ones are attached to _mi _3k _2j _3w objects while you scroll. So I think I have to keep a list of the ones we've done before. And since elements become stale, I have to extract the info I want after each change of frame.
